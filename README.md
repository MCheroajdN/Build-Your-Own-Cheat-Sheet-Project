# Build Your Own Cheat sheet.
During my Full Stack Developer Course with Codecademy, this was a challenge project requirement to build own note reference cheat sheet using table: Code [_here_].
To help test and solidify my knowledge of HTML and CSS, we were asked to choose any topic from learning journey and create a cheat sheet in a tabular form. I have created a CSS Selector & Specificity Cheat Sheet and has helped me understand a lot more about this topic.
